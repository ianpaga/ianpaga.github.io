## Neutrinos in astrophysics 

Welcome to my website :-)

My research focuses on neutrino flavor oscillations in astrophysical dense media, such as core-collapse supernovae and the remnants of neutron star mergers. These very dense environments allow us to learn about the quantum mechanical behavior of matter under extreme conditions and thus represent a unique site for learning new physics.

I completed my PhD at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/research/astrophysics/astronu/) (Denmark) in 2022 working with [Prof. Irene Tamborra](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/526828) on neutrino flavor conversion in dense astrophysical media. Before that, I was a master's student at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/i-uoh-lu-NAFYK-TEFY) (Sweden) working under the supervision of [Prof. Roman Pasechnik](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/roman-pasechnik) on the phenomenology of three-Higgs doublet models. Since then, I've been broadly interested in the intersection between particle physics and astrophysics.

Since [I joined SLAC and Stanford](https://theory.slac.stanford.edu/person/ian-padilla-gay) in 2023, I have been focusing on understanding how elements heavier than iron, for instance, the proton-rich isotopes Molybdenum $^{92,94}\mathrm{Mo}$  and Niobium $^{92}\mathrm{Nb}$ are created via the $\nu p$-process and how neutrino flavor conversion might alter our understanding of this physical process. The origin of the solar system abundances of several proton-rich isotopes like Molybdenum and Ruthenium has been a mystery in nuclear astrophysics. One possible way of creating these isotopes is through the $\nu p$-process which can operate in neutrino-driven outflows in core-collapse supernovae.
